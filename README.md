I am using the pandas, sklearn and matplotlib libraries in the project. The database contains data about pesticide use in different countries. 

Using a Simple linear Regression model for pesticide use in Mexico.

The data file must be in the same directory as the ipynb file.

This project is built using: Python (3.9.7), Jupyter notebook (7.0.4), Pandas (2.1.1), and Matplotlib (3.8.0).
